# SimpleShare
`SimpleShare` is a file-hosting website that allows quick uploads of files up to 100MB, but here's the catch: Once somebody downloads a file it is deleted from the server. While this website serves no real practical purpose, it was a good learning experience for managing and uploading files with PHP. I also had to hack together a file verification system that prevented certain file types from being uploaded. It probably isn't the most secure way of blocking malicious files (For instance, .exe files can be disguised as .pdf files) but it works to a certain extent.

## Why?

There I was, browsing /r/webdev, when I saw the owner of [serverbros.co.uk](http://www.serverbros.co.uk/) offering free hosting with 5GB storage for life for the first twenty people who commented on his post. Quiet proud of myself, I began brainstorming ways I could best waste my new hosting plan. Simple Share was thus conceived.
